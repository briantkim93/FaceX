# FaceX
FaceX is a facial recognition system that performs authentication for access to protected facilities. FaceX utilizes computer vision and artificial intelligence to recognize a face and distinguish unknown people from known people. FaceX simulates the operations of a system can be planted on the doors or somewhere near the entrance to a particular facility. The need to protect resources and facilities from illegal access and vandalism facilitated the development of this system. This system is a mere simulation and does not involve actual planted hardware
